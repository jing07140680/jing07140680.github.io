### AI Infrastructure Workflow

#### 1. Workflow Overview
The workflow involves several stages to manage data effectively from various sources to actionable insights. Key stages include:

- Extract (Data Source to Data Lake)
- Transform (Data Processing)
- Load to Data Warehouse
- Query & Analytics


#### 2. Extract (Data Source to Data Lake)
- **Data Sources**: Raw data is extracted from:
  - MySQL databases for structured data.
  - REST APIs for dynamic data from web services.
  - Logs for unstructured or semi-structured data.
  
- **ETL Tools**: Tools like Apache Airflow or NiFi orchestrate the data extraction process.

- **Data Lake Options**:
  - Amazon S3 (AWS)
  - HDFS (On-premises Hadoop)
  - Azure Data Lake Storage (Azure)
  - Google Cloud Storage (GCP)

#### 3. Transform (Data Processing with Apache Spark)
- **Processing Tool**: Use Apache Spark for:
  - Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values.
  - Data Transformation: Converting formats, normalizing values, feature engineering.

- **Intermediate Storage**: Store processed data back into the data lake (e.g., Amazon S3, HDFS) for further analysis.

#### 4. Load to Data Warehouse (ETL Process)
- **Data Pipeline**: Automate the transfer of cleaned data to a data warehouse using Airflow or NiFi.

- **Data Warehouse Options**:
  - Amazon Redshift for large-scale analytics on AWS.
  - Google BigQuery for fast, serverless querying on GCP.
  - Snowflake for cross-cloud compatibility and flexibility.

#### 5. Query & Analytics (SQL-based Querying and BI Tools)
- **SQL Queries**: Once data is loaded, it can be queried using standard SQL.

- **BI Tools**: Connect data warehouses to tools like:
  - Tableau
  - Power BI
  - Looker
- These tools provide insights and visualizations for decision-making.
